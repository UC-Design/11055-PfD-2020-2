Reflection:
The goal of the project was to be able to search for book using ISBN number and our result for the project
 was able to achieve this goal and I have learnt a lot of new things from the project. At the start of the 
 project me and my group panther figure out who was going to do what. We decide that I would do the flowchart
  and they would do the pseudocode. For the programming and html side of the project we decide we would both 
  do even amount of work for that section. Overall, I believe as group we worked quite well together and were
   able to finish with a good final product that tick the boxes of what we need to do.  In the project, 
   I learnt more about classes and how there worked and the uses of arrays. This project has expanded my Programming 
   knowledge and learning how to work in a team for a programming environment.
