/*Lea Jehanno week 9
 this is the first exercise for week 9 - OOP and JSON
//object orientated : lets you create objects that hold state over time. SImilar concept to arrays but with more variables inside.

//objects variables = properties

//create a variable

var book = {
    name:"Not_Even_Bones",
    author:"Rebecca_Shaeffer",
    year:"2018",
    published:"US"
};

//then create a for loop to access properties either like an array. You can write in two different options :
// document.write(book["name"]);

//or directly using dot notation
// When you run this, the name of the book is written in top left corner
document.write(book.name)
